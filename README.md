Donkey Kong Country (US) 1.0
========

This is a WIP decompilation of Donkey Kong Country. 

The purpose of the project is to recreate a source code base for the game from scratch, using information found inside the game along with static and/or dynamic analysis. 

**It is not, and will not, produce a PC port**.

## Overview

The only version currently supported is `SNES US v1.0`. It was initially made by using [`snes2asm`](https://github.com/nathancassano/snes2asm) disassembly tool on a SNES US v1.0 ROM copy. 

This decompilation mostly contains game and audio code. As assets are proprietary and copyrighted by Nintendo Ltd, you will not find any of these in this project. Sharing it here would take us down.

You can use `snes2asm` for data assets such as `graphics`, `tilemaps`, `palettes`, `audio`, and `text` and be extracted by specifying a YAML configuration file. (See [Configuration](https://github.com/nathancassano/snes2asm?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) section).

## Features
* ROM disassembly.
* SPC700 audio processor disassembly support.

## Structure

The disassemble uses the following project structure:

```
dkc-recomp/
├── Makefile              # Build configuration
├── hdr.asm               # Game header
├── snes.asm              # SNES register definitions
├── bank_00.asm           # Bank 0 assembly code
├── bank_01.asm           # Bank 1 assembly code
├── ...                   # Additional banks
├── spc700.asm            # SPC700 audio assembly code
├── sprites1_gfx.chr      # Extracted graphics (if configured)
├── sprites1_gfx.png      # PNG preview (if palette provided)
├── sprites1_pal.pal      # Extracted palettes
└── game.smc              # Reassembled ROM (after make)
```

## Compilation

### Requirements

For compiling the project, you will need:

* **[WLA-DX Assembler](https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx)**
* **GNU Make**

### Usage

You can test compilation and reassemble ROM.

```bash
cd dkc-decomp
# Edit Makefile PREFIX to point to your wla-dx install path
make
# Done! Run the game.smc file in your emulator.
```
